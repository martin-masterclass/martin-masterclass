👋 **Hi, I am Martin, nice to meet you!**


👀 I’m interested in B2B / E-Commerce / SAAS projects, Business processes and concepts in the internet, and everything about LARAVEL
 

🌱 I’m currently building my Laravel Academy. You can have a look here: https://laravel-academy.com 

At [LaravelAcademy.com](https://laravelacademy.com) there is also a newsletter you can subscribe to, where you can get discount offers for all my Laravel courses.
 
💞️ I LOVE to teach Laravel and I LOVE to help people building their apps.
 

📫 For ANYTHING, just get in contact with me here: hello@laravelacademy.com
